    <h2>General:</h2>
    <p class="first">I first develop in Firefox with Firebug and the Web Developers Toolbar enabled. I code everything by hand and use an FTP program to upload my files, but I am familiar with using Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 as well. Jquery is my library of choice at this point, but I am familiar with others as well. I am familiar and can recognize most code, whether it is PHP, Ruby, or ASP/ASPX: I am most familiar with programming in PHP however.</p>
