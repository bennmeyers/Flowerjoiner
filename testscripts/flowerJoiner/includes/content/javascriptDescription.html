  <h2>Javascript:</h2>
  <p class="first">
      I've worked with Final Cut Pro, so I am familiar with many transitions, but my main goal is that the user experience is solid.
  </p>
  <p>
      I spend some time commenting the code after I do a project. The re-usability of functions and elements is very important: ideally all elements can be used by as many different applications as possible. But equally important the code should quick to read by anyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
      I also use other peoples code regularly, since it's often more thoroughly tested than mine. But I would prefer my own code to be used, since I find that often other code is not dynamic and so doesn't work in all cases. Every piece of code has something to be learned from it though, and so should not be thrown away without inspection.
