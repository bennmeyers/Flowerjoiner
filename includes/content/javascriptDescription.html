			<h2>Javascript:</h2>
		    <p class="first">I've worked with Final Cut Pro, so I am familiar with many transitions, but my main goal is that the user experience is solid.</p>
		    <p>I spend some time commenting the code after I do a project. The re-usability of functions and elements is very important: ideally all elements can be used by as many different applications as possible. But equally important the code should quick to read by anyone else.</p>
			<p>As I said, I feel most comfortable with jQuery. It allows for simple flexibility: powerful interaction techniques are available when only a little code is written. It encourages me to perform new actions, the way javascript does, and paves the way to more powerful user tools.</p>
			<p>When I'm coding for either javascript or jQuery, I try to re-use code as much as possible. I do not enjoy having multiple files with the same basic code that all have to be updated. So separate functions are a method I use often.</p>
