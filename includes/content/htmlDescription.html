			                    A little more work in the beginning usually leads to faster updates in the end, so all my code should be easy to view and easy to edit, and so is separated out into component parts.

			                <p>
			                    I use PHP includes and AJAX calls to fill content with XML or HTML files. Each include file is marked up symantically, and is separated out to hold a select group of data so that a change can be made global. I also allow for page specific code and styles for situations where global statements just don't apply on a page, so I have the flexibility of finely defining styles on a case-by-case basis.

			                    <p class="first">I have some things I strive for in my coding. First of all, I try to stick with W3C compliency most of the time, but not at the cost of correct design. I check through at least six browsers after I complete a page - Safari, Mac/Windows Firefox, Mac/Windows Opera, and Windows Internet Explorer - to see if the W3C complient page also renders correctly in all these browsers. I have a set of priorities when writing HTML, all of which must be followed:</p>
			                    <ol class="first">
			                        <li class="first">Pages are W3C compliant.</li>
			                        <li>Pages look like mock in multiple browsers.</li>
			                        <li>Pages look like mocks/design concepts, any changes are verified with Designer.</li>
			                        <li>Code is Symantic.</li>
			                    </ol>
